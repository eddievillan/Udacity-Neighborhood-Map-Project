Basic Description
This project is used to show the Davis California area and my favorite spots.

The Foursquare API is implemented to collect the phone number of markers, then displays the phone number in the info window.

You can search for places in Davis through the search on the right, simply enter what you want to find and press enter.

Enjoy!
